<h2>Third Component</h2>

<p>ThirdComponent has a route defined that is a child of the path for SecondComponent. ThirdComponent is then output through the <code>router-outlet</code> in the SecondComponent.</p>

<p>The child path for a component follows the form "parent/child".</p>

<p>I don't know if this makes it a child of SecondComponent or not.</p>
